The simpleSnake.jar file is designed to run using 2 arguments.
The first argument is the horizontal size of the playable grid (sizeX), 
    while the second argument is the vertical size of said grid (sizeY).

If run without arguments the program will default to a 10 by 10 grid.
    If only 1 argument is given the grid is sizeX by 10.

If run from file explorer the game will open with a grid of 10 by 10.

The command to run the game is:
    java -jar simpleSnake.jar sizeX sizeY
